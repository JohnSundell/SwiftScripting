## Examples

### [Marathon Examples](https://github.com/johnsundell/marathon-examples)

A collection of example Swift scripts that can easily be run using Marathon.

### [Playground](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Playground)

Instantly create Swift playgrounds from the command line.

### [Selenops](https://github.com/zntfdr/Selenops)

A stupid simple Swift Web Crawler.

## Contributing

This list is still in its early days, so a lot of awesome stuff is sure to be missing. If you know of a tool, framework or example that should be on this list - [**add it and open a PR**](https://github.com/JohnSundell/SwiftScripting/edit/master/README.md)! 👍 Before you do though, here are some quick guidelines:

- You can totally add your own creations.
- Only add things that are open source, and that are generally useful for Swift scripting.
- Don't add general Swift frameworks such as JSON mappers or networking libraries (there are other lists for that).
- Keep the list in alphabetical order.
- Follow the same style as for the other entries.
- No more than 2 lines of description for each entry.

Looking forward to your contributions and seeing this list grow! 🎉
